- One person talking about using etcd for service discovery as they're
  already experimenting with CoreOS
- etcd just been re-written from the ground up for v2.0

** Bootstrapping
- Challenges setting up etcd cluster that might be better in Consul is
  the bootstrapping. How does the first node talk to other nodes?
- DNS probably the easiest way
- discovery coreos service offered by CoreOS
- Chef search been handy when setting up ZooKeeper clusters


* Q: AWS and cloud platforms, how do you organise your deployments
- First step: make sure you're deploying across AZes in AWS (hopefully this
  is obvious)
- Returning results from within a single AZ useful for latency
  reseasons
- Raft based systems need to be quite close to each other in network
  terms.
  - In a two AZ setup, this can be awkward
    
* Anyone using Smartstack?
- Yup, pretty simple, few people here using it
  - You still need to get the service discovery sorted and
    stable. Once that's done, you're probably good.

* Anyone using service discovery purely using AWS API?
- Some people are.
  - Concern is that when you're starting up a lot of machines, that's
    probably when AWS is under stress and APIs are doing to start
    misbehaving, 
- Would be nice if Amazon returned quota info in response, but they'd
  need to tell you want that is ;)

* hands up for people using etcd, consul et cetera in prod
- about half the room put a hand up
- Few war stories
  - Zookeeper, one node in weird state
  - Consul using fact to 
- Mention of confd, gconf for etcd and consul template.
  - 10k keys in YAML hard work with consul template, but OK on a t2.micro
- General consensus is that is generally works, not so scare
** Anything bad to say about consul?
   - Used as distributed lock. Masters, no agent.
     - 5 node cluster, does get hammered (Every machine in estate, 1-2
       qps)
     - Still just works.
   - Still awaiting ACL/auth, coming in 0.5.0.
   - SSL may be a new thing
   - Make sure you disable the console mode!

* Anyone using consul watch?
- There's a SysAdvent post from 2014 to read.
- Few people using it.

* Anything else that people want to know?
** How to restrict access to trees of keys in Consul?
- The ACLs should cover that
** "I need time!" - how to justify getting service discovery in
- Very chicken and egg, need service discover ahead of scaling out,
  but can't justify until you have you scale out.
- Zookeeper has been the only kid on the block for a while
- DNS based services and good to explain to other people. DNS is after
  all a sort of discovery service.
** What's the Consul uptake like?
- Open source in this space still very new
- But lots of open source is coming out of companies
- Early days yet and lots of politics between the company-sponsored
  things.
** Are we going to see an explosion of service discovery days?
- ..and logging, and monitoring, etc :)
- Consul and etcd both written in Go, seems hard to convert into
  libraries.
  - Might be something to say about writing something that can be
    shared

* Reminder: not everyone is running on AWS. (Slight tangent)
- War stories for every time there's a Xen vuln :)
- Three that are on AWS also on other cloud
- Two in the room on their on bare tiny

* Tangent: if you're in AWS, lock down the instance roles
  - lock down to IP address
  - Does get rotated after 15-20 min (con

* Flapjack
- Started as a whole monitoring system, now re-focused on escalations
  and notifications
- Bulletproof.com.au
- No-one here using it. :(
